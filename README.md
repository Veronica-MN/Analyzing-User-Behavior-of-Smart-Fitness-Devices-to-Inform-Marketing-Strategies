## Data Governance Protocols

The dataset used in this analysis was generated through a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. The dataset is stored in Kaggle as ![Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) and available through Mobius.

- The data was obtained through informed consent from participants regarding the purpose and use of their data.
- Anonymized or pseudonymized personally identifiable information to protect privacy.
- Ensured compliance with relevant regulations and ethical considerations throughout the data collection process.
   - Trustworthiness of the Source: Google provided the Google Data Analytics certificate, indicating credibility and adherence to data privacy and security standards.
   - Trustworthiness of the Platform: The dataset is hosted on Kaggle, a reputable platform known for its commitment to data privacy and security.
- Transparency and Openness: Organizations that are transparent about their processes are more likely to have implemented robust data security measures.

## Addressing Data Quality Limitations

- The sample size of the data is small, only 30 individuals were considered
- The data is several years old, which may not accurately reflect the current state of Fitbit devices, given the rapid evolution of technology since the data was collected.
- The weight-related data is limited to just 8 participants. Furthermore, several entries in the data fields are missing, and a significant portion of the weight data was manually inputted
- Data collected via surveys may lack accuracy, as participants might not always provide truthful responses

# Process

## Applications
Excel is used to load the data, Python to transform and explore the data and Tableau to interactively visualise the data. 

## Choosing Data Files

`dailyActivity_merged.csv` file contains most of the data including the summary of the steps and calories burned while the `sleepDay_merged.csv` file provides sleep data. The two files are ideal to analyze the participants usage. Additional files such as the `dailyCalories_merged.csv` and the `weightLogInfo_merged.csv` will also be used to give additional data from device usage. 

## Data Preprocessing Steps for Initial Analysis

import libraries to setup environment and import datasets

1. Convert data type for 'ActivityDate' column to a datetime data type
2. The `weightLogInfo_merged` file contains a 'Fat' field/column which contains missing values therefore this will not be used to draw insights
3. Ensure that there are no blank entries int he data using filters

## Transform and Explore Data

The final dataframe contains 940 daily activities recorded, 940 daily calories entries recorded, 413 daily sleep data recorded, 22099 hourly steps data recorded and 65 NaN values in the weightloginfo_data. All Python code can be found [here](Bellabeat_Project.ipynb) 

1. previewing and summaring datasets
2. rename  ActivityDatem SleepDay and Date to convert to date data type
3. remove duplicates
4. Merging datasets

```python
daily_activity_data['ActivityDate'] = pd.to_datetime(daily_activity_data['ActivityDate'])
daily_activity_data.rename(columns={'ActivityDate': 'Date'}, inplace=True)
daily_activity_data.info()

```python
sleepday_data.duplicated().sum()

```
merged_df['WeekDay'] = merged_df['ActivityHour'].dt.day_name()
merged_df.head()
