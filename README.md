![Bellabeat](bella.png)

In this Capstone Project from the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, I will follow the six steps of the data analysis process:
1. Ask
2. Prepare
3. Process
4. Analyse
5. Share
6. Act

These analysis steps will help give insights into the Fitbit Fitness Tracker data in order to gain some insights that could be beneficial for Bellabeat.
