# Bellabeat-Project

![Bellabeat](bella.png)

In this Capstone Project from the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, I will follow the six steps of the data analysis process:
**Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyse, Share, Act**

These analysis steps will help give insights into the Fitbit Fitness Tracker data in order to gain some insights that could be beneficial for Bellabeat.
